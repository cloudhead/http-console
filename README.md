http-console
============

> Speak HTTP like a local

Talking to an HTTP server with `curl` can be fun, but most of the time it's a `PITA`.

`http-console` is a simple and intuitive interface for speaking the HTTP protocol.

*PS: HTTP has never been this much fun.*

synopsis
--------

![http-console](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/251849/http-console.png)

installation
------------

*http-console* was written for [node](http://nodejs.org), so make sure you have that installed
first. Then you need [npm](http://github.com/isaacs/npm), node's package manager.

Once you're all set, run:

    $ npm install http-console

It'll download the dependencies, and install the command-line tool in `/usr/local/bin`.

### Installing the bleeding edge #

The latest release will often be available on npm as `http-console@latest`, so you can run:

    $ npm install http-console@latest

Alternatively, you can download a tarball of this repo, or clone it. Just make sure you have
the latest version of node.

introduction
------------

Let's assume we have a [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) instance running locally.

### connecting #

To connect, we run `http-console`, passing it the server host and port as such:

    $ http-console 127.0.0.1:5984 

### navigating #

Once connected, we should see the *http prompt*:

    http://127.0.0.1:5984/>

server navigation is similar to directory navigation, except a little simpler:

    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> /logs
    http://127.0.0.1:5984/logs> /46
    http://127.0.0.1:5984/logs/46> ..
    http://127.0.0.1:5984/logs> ..
    http://127.0.0.1:5984/>

### requesting #

HTTP requests are issued with the HTTP verbs *GET*, *PUT*, *POST*, *HEAD* and *DELETE*, and
a relative path:

    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> GET /
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Mon, 31 May 2010 04:43:39 GMT
    Content-Length: 41

    {
        couchdb: "Welcome",
        version: "0.11.0"
    }

    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> GET /bob
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    Date: Mon, 31 May 2010 04:45:32 GMT
    Content-Length: 44

    {
        error: "not_found",
        reason: "no_db_file"
    }

When issuing *POST* and *PUT* commands, we have the opportunity to send data too:

    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> /rabbits
    http://127.0.0.1:5984/rabbits> POST
    ... {"name":"Roger"}

    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Location: http://127.0.0.1/rabbits/2fd9db055885e6982462a10e54003127
    Date: Mon, 31 May 2010 05:09:15 GMT
    Content-Length: 95

    {
        ok: true,
        id: "2fd9db055885e6982462a10e54003127",
        rev: "1-0c3db91854f26486d1c3922f1a651d86"
    }

Make sure you have your `Content-Type` header set properly, if the API requires it. More
in the section below.

> Note that if you're trying to POST to a form handler, you'll most probably want to send data
in `multipart/form-data` format, such as `name=roger&hair=black`. http-console sends your POST/PUT data *as is*,
so make sure you've got the format right, and the appropriate `Content-Type` header.

### setting headers #

Sometimes, it's useful to set HTTP headers:

    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> Accept: application/json
    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> X-Lodge: black

These headers are sent with all requests in this session. To see all active headers,
run the `.headers` command:

    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> .headers
    Accept: application/json
    X-Lodge: black

Removing headers is just as easy:

    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> Accept:
    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> .headers
    X-Lodge: black

Because JSON is such a common data format, http-console has a way to automatically set
the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`. Just pass the `--json` option when
starting http-console, or run the `.json` command:

    $ http-console 127.0.0.1:5984 --json
    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> .headers
    Accept: */*
    Content-Type: application/json

### cookies #

You can enable cookie tracking with the `--cookies` option flag.
To see what cookies are stored, use the `.cookies` command.

### SSL #

To enable SSL, pass the `--ssl` flag, or specify the address with `https`.

### quitting #

    http://127.0.0.1:5984/> .q

nuff' said.
